# MIDORI Trademark and Brand Policy

Effective date: 2026-02-16

This policy governs use of the MIDORI name and official branding assets.

## 1. Project Marks

"MIDORI", the MIDORI logo, and related project marks are used to identify the official language project and official distributions.

## 2. Allowed Use Without Permission

You may use the name "MIDORI" in nominative/descriptive ways, such as:

- saying software is "built with MIDORI"
- linking to this repository
- discussing compatibility, benchmarks, or tutorials

You may also reference unmodified logos for news, commentary, and educational context where it does not imply endorsement.

## 3. Uses Requiring Permission

Do not use MIDORI branding in a way that may confuse users into believing your project, company, fork, package, extension, installer, or service is official when it is not.

Examples that require explicit permission:

- using MIDORI name/logo as primary branding of a commercial product
- distributing modified logos as "official MIDORI" branding
- registering domains or package names that imply official ownership

## 4. Forks and Derivatives

Forks are allowed under license terms, but should use distinct naming and branding to avoid user confusion.

## 5. Reservation of Rights

All rights in MIDORI marks not expressly granted in this policy are reserved.

## 6. Contact

For branding/trademark permission requests, open a repository issue and label it as a branding request.
