# MIDORI Privacy Statement

Effective date: 2026-02-16

This document describes privacy expectations for MIDORI project tooling and channels.

## 1. MIDORI CLI and Compiler

The MIDORI CLI/compiler in this repository does not include built-in telemetry or analytics collection by default.

## 2. Local Processing

MIDORI commands process source files on your machine. Build artifacts, lockfiles, and temporary files are created locally unless you choose to upload/share them.

## 3. VS Code Extension (Local Dev Package)

The extension included in `vscode-extension/` runs diagnostics by invoking your configured local MIDORI command. It does not define separate remote telemetry in this repository by default.

## 4. Third-Party Platforms

If you use GitHub, package registries, CI services, or documentation hosting, those platforms may collect data under their own privacy policies.

## 5. User-Submitted Data

Information you submit voluntarily (issues, pull requests, discussions, logs, crash output) may be stored publicly according to repository visibility and platform rules.

## 6. Security Reporting

Avoid posting sensitive secrets in public channels. If sensitive information is involved, contact maintainers privately before sharing full reproduction details.

## 7. Changes

This statement may be updated over time. The effective date above indicates the current revision.
