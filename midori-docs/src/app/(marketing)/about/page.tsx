      <h1>About MIDORI</h1>
      <p>
        MIDORI is a programming language project focused on readable syntax, safe defaults,
        and deterministic performance. The ecosystem is being built with a compiler-first
        mindset and explicit specification discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        The documentation site is version-aligned with compiler releases to reduce drift and
        make migration clear for users and contributors.
